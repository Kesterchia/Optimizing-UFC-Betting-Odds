## About this project:
Sports betting is a multi-billion dollar industry. UFC fight betting is one of the many kinds of sports betting. In every fight, betting sites assign "odds" to each fighter based on how confident they feel in each fighter. Choosing the wrong betting odds can be devastating to a betting site, losing them a significant amount of money. This project aims to create a model that can predict the win probabilities in UFC fights, and output an optimal set of betting odds that can aid betting sites in choosing the best odds to maximize profit and reduce risk.

## Context:

This dataset is a merger of a few datasets on Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fights on Kaggle, compiled by Kaggle user Mdabbert (https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert).

## Content:

This dataset includes:

Rajeev Warrier's excellent dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/rajeevw/ufcdata). This dataset makes up much of the data. It contains data for every UFC bout. The 'red fighter' and 'blue fighter' are improperly recorded prior to around 2010, so that data has been excluded.

Mdabbert's odds dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/ufc-fights-2010-2020-with-betting-odds). This contains gambling odds for each fight.

Mart JÃ¼risoo's Rankings dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/ufc-rankings). Includes a history of UFC fighter rankings. 

There are 108 columns of data.
